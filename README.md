# Snippetbox

This web application, called Snippetbox, is what you can create by the end of the
book [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards. I highly recommend it.

I added a container build and push GitHubs Actions workflow and database migrations to create the necessary
database tables when a container is run.
