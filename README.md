# Snippetbox

This web application, called Snippetbox, is what you can create by the end of the
book [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards. I highly recommend it.

Updates:
* container build and push GitHubs Actions workflow.
* database migrations.
* prototype counter feature.
* prototype owner role.

Create an owner user at `/user/signup` to start posting snippets and adding users.
